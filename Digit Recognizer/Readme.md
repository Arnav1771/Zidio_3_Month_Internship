# MNIST Digit Recognizer

This project is a machine learning application that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It leverages various Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pickle`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

Setup and Usage
Clone the repository:

Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the mnist-digit-recognizer.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and execute the cells to train the model and visualize the results.

Project Structure
mnist-digit-recognizer.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the digit recognizer.

Description of Libraries
numpy: Used for numerical operations.
seaborn: Used for statistical data visualization.
matplotlib: Used for plotting graphs and visualizations.
scikit-learn: Provides tools for machine learning, including the SGDClassifier for training the model, and functions for cross-validation and evaluation.
pickle: Used for serializing and deserializing Python objects.
